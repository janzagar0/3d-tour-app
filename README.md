# **McKeldin Library 3D Tour Web Application**
This project was built by the University of Maryland Libraries GIS & Data Services team. Its purpose is to provide an interactive, web-based tool for the community to explore
the contents of McKeldin Library's paper map collection, which holds over 200,000 items spanning a wide variety of categories and topics. This project was inspired by Arizona
State University Map and Geospatial Hub's 3D Explorer web application, and we would like to thank them for their generous guidance and advice provided.
