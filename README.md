# **McKeldin Library 3D Tour Web Application**
This project was built by Jose Anza Garcia while working with the University of Maryland Libraries GIS & Data Services team. Its purpose is to provide an interactive, web-based tool for the community to explore
the contents of McKeldin Library's paper map collection, which holds over 200,000 items spanning a wide variety of categories and topics. This project was inspired by Arizona
State University Map and Geospatial Hub's 3D Explorer web application, and we would like to thank them for their generous guidance and advice provided. 

## **About the Project**
The 3D model of the map collection was created in ArcGIS Pro using geometry creation and editing techniques and extensive field measurements obtained using a handheld laser measurement tool (similar to [this](https://shop.leica-geosystems.com/global/measurement-tools/disto/leica-disto-overview)). This model is hosted as a web scene with its component scene layers and feature layers in an ArcGIS Online cloud environment. The actual web application was built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using the ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript mapping library. Stay tuned for more detailed information on this project's workflow.
